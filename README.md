# LameAssPocketIcons
These are a collection of Analogue Pocket icons you can use for your AP SD card so that it's a little less lame in Windows. This isn't _entirely_ the complete set of icons.

Just click on an icon you want, download it, or download the entire collection of icons if ya want, I don't care. 

All icons were created for myself to be Windows 10+ compatible and supporting the following icon sizes:
16x16
32x32
48x48
256x256

(It's the standard full set of icon sizes. Oh, boushie.)

Included in this repository, are the following fancy shmancy colors:

## To implement an icon:
1. download the folder for the one ya want
2. copy the two files in the folder to the root of your Analogue Pocket's SD card
3. touch your nose
4. safely remove the sd card from the pc, put it in your Analogue Pocket or back into the pc, hum a little tune, stop touching your nose, and then see that the magic happened!
5. run out into your yard for a celebritory dance, just stay off my lawn.



Note: The images used for the icons are copyright Analogue. I've just downloaded them from their press documenation and formatted them into pretty little lame ass icons.
